= Git templates

To help write good commit messages (which will/can be reused as PR messages) we put
a `git_commit_template` in this repo to use as a good default.

Here is one way how to use it with git command line for all your repositories.

```
$ ln -s <path-to-jbosstools>/jbosstools-devdoc/source/git_commit_template ~/.gitmessage
$ git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

NOTE: You can of course also just do the `git config` with the full path. The use of a link
above just makes it easier to use the template from other git tools.

Now when you do a `git commit` it will pre-load the editor with this template.

And if you use `hub` to open PR's and follow the conventions in the template
it will look awesome on both command line and in github UI.
