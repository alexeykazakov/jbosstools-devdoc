How to contribute/edit documentation
====================================

There are two recommended ways to contribute to the documentation, using the github web ui or offline local editing by cloning the repository. 
You can do almost everything in both places, the main limitations of github web ui is that they currently do not support upload of images nor delete of content.
The table below outlines the various options/workflows:

[options="header"]
|=========================
| *Task* | local/offline | github.com/online 
| *Create text file* | git add + commit + push |  Click the '+' icon, name the file and submit 
| *Add image/binary* | git add + commit + push | N/A
| *Edit content* | git commit + push | Click the 'Edit' button, edit and submit
| *Delete content* | git rm + commit + push | Not available, http://prose.io/ is an alternative UI that allows deletes
| *Notifications* | N/A | click 'Watch' repository and you can control the amount of notifications you get 
| *Comments* | N/A | use the github issue tracker to ask for clarifications or simply submit suggestions as a pull-request
|=========================

Note: *Everyone* can contribute to the documentation, JBoss Tools committers all have push access and any non-committers can 
edit and they will be turned into pull-requests which a committer can then apply. Even if the edits are not applied directly 
your edits are visible in your fork.

Content guidelines
==================

* Content should be for how to develop and/or contribute to JBoss Tools
* Should not contain user guides for plugins functionallity unless that guide is needed for debugging/tracing/exploring the plugin. User guides are in each plugin or at http://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-documentation
* Use asciidoc (.adoc) wherever possible, see http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference[Asciidoc quick reference] for syntax.
* If you got existing content you want to convert to asciidoc http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/[Pandoc] works great for almost any reasonable format (especially with https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/868[this patch] applied)
* use lowercase with _'s for space in filenames. (i.e. `how_to_contribute.adoc` is Good, 'How_To_Contribute.adoc' or 'howtocontribute.adoc' is Bad)
