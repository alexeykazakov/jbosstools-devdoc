== JBoss Tools Developer Documentation

This repository contains documentation for building and developing JBoss Tools.

It is meant to replace the articles related to development at jboss.org wiki found at https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossTools

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[Contributing] for how to write/add to these docs.

In general it is to be a wiki all developers can push docs to, external contributors can do pull-requests or report issues
to get things clarified/documented better.
